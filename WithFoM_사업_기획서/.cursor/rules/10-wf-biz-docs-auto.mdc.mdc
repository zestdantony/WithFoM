# WF BIZ Docs Rules (MODE=BIZ only)

## 0) Activation
- Apply this rule ONLY when MODE=BIZ (set by WF Router).
- If MODE is DEV or CODE, ignore this entire file.

## 1) What this rule does
- Enforce your "문서 작성 헌법(Constitution)" for business/policy/proposal docs.
- Execute-first: when the user instructs to modify, do it and report the result (do not ask clarification).
- If something is impossible/ambiguous, mark "확인 필요" in the report ONLY.

## 2) Your Constitution (paste-in)
- IMPORTANT: To avoid accidental changes, paste your full constitution text here verbatim.
- The assistant must follow it strictly for BIZ docs.

## 3) Added Structure Rules (BIZ only)
- Overview numbering: use ".0" for section overview (e.g., 1.0. 섹션 개요).
- Long content handling:
  - If a section becomes long, convert that section into a folder.
  - Create the next level as files inside the folder.
- Same-level mixing ban:
  - Within one parent folder, do not mix files and folders for the same level.
- 5th-level numbering inheritance:
  - The first segment of 5th-level numbering must equal the last number of its 4th-level.
  - Example: under 7-2-2-3 → 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 ...

## 4) File Tag Recommendation
- For BIZ docs, the first line of the file should be:
  - <!-- WF:DOC=BIZ -->
