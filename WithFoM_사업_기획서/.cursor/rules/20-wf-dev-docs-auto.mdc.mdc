# WF DEV Docs Rules (MODE=DEV only)

## 0) Activation
- Apply this rule ONLY when MODE=DEV (set by WF Router).
- If MODE is BIZ or CODE, ignore this entire file.

## 1) 핵심 목적
- 문서(명세) + 코드블록이 섞인 파일을 안전하게 다룬다.
- 코드블록(```...```) 내부는 원칙적으로 손대지 않는다.
- 문서 구조(번호/개요/폴더/파일 분할)는 적용하되, 코드에 방해되는 규칙(전각공백 강제, 줄끝 2칸 강제 등)은 코드블록에 적용하지 않는다.

## 2) Code Block Safety (최우선)
- Never modify content inside fenced code blocks (```json, ```js, ```jsx, etc.) unless the user explicitly requests a change inside that block.
- Never add/remove trailing spaces, indentation, or wrapping inside code blocks.
- Do not enforce full-width space indentation inside code blocks.

## 3) Structure Rules (DEV docs)
- Overview numbering uses ".0" (e.g., 1.0. 섹션 개요).
- If content becomes long, folderize that level; next level becomes files.
- Same-level mixing ban: in one parent folder, same-level items cannot mix files and folders.
- 5th-level numbering inheritance: under 4th-level X-Y-Z-N → 5th-level starts with N.* (e.g., N.0, N.1 ...).

## 4) Reporting (Result-only)
- After execution, report:
  - what changed (sections/files)
  - what was created (folders/files)
  - any "확인 필요" items

## 5) File Tag Recommendation
- For DEV docs, the first line of the file should be:
  - <!-- WF:DOC=DEV -->
