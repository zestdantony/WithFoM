# WF CODE Mode Rules (MODE=CODE only)

## 0) Activation
- Apply this rule ONLY when MODE=CODE (set by WF Router).
- If MODE is BIZ or DEV, ignore this entire file.

## 1) Output Standard
- Prefer code-first output.
- If output is shown in markdown, wrap code in fenced code blocks.
- Do not apply any document constitution formatting rules (no full-width space rules, no trailing-two-spaces rules, no markdown list-escape constraints).

## 2) Safety
- Do not change files beyond what the user asked.
- When editing existing code, preserve style and conventions found in the file unless the user asked to refactor.
